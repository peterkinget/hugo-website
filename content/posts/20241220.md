**Posted on LinkedIn:** Want to offer your students hands-on labs in your integrated-circuits courses connecting measurement, simulation, and analysis? We created the MOSbius chip for that purpose! Documentation and example experiments are available at https://mosbius.org. 

The 68-pin MOSbius chip contains nMOS and pMOS devices as individual transistors, and in typical configurations like current mirrors, differential pairs, common-source configuration, simple operational transconductance amplifiers or inverters. Circuits can be built with external wires and there is also a 65x10 on-chip digitally controlled switch matrix than can connect each of the 63 transistor-terminal pins and the VDD and VSS to 10 buses on the chip to build circuits.

The MOSbius platform offers the chip, an adapter PCB to place the chip on a solderless breadboard, and software tools to program the chip and process the measurement results. An LTspice library is also provided to run circuit simulations.

The platform allows the (student) designer to experiment with, and learn about, IC style MOS circuits in a uniquely hands-on environment. They measure practical CMOS circuits and compare their operation to analytical models and to circuit simulations.

This fall semester we offered a first sequence of circuit labs in my Analog Electronic Circuits course for senior and graduate students. Students strongly appreciated the learning opportunity of interacting with real implementations of the circuits studied in the course. 

Do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to use MOSbius in your courses. 

Last but not least, make sure to check out the [MOSbius Crew](https://mosbius.org/9_back_matter/acknowledgments.html) to see all the enthusiastic contributors to this project.
