Proud to present my new website developed with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. I plan to write up a HowTo post in the near future. 

# How did I build this website?

**NOTE:** *I am not trying to write a full tutorial, there are (too) many already out there. I am outlining how I went about building this website and I am documenting some things I had to learn the hard way, i.e. lost too much time for something that was relatively simple in hindsight but I just did not find it easily in the existing tutorials.*

## HUGO

I am using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) since it's active, has templates, and builds a static website from source files on your computer. You do not get locked into some hosting service's proprietary publishing software or templates. 

First, I googled [site:edu "powered by Hugo"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:.edu+%22powered+by+hugo%22) to see what templates academics are using. The ones that I liked were 'PaperMod', 'Hugo Cards', and 'Hugo Coder' for a personal profile site; 'Docks' and 'Academic Theme` are probably more suited for a research group site. 

### Template

I settled for [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) and more specifically used the [modified version by Pascal Michaillet](https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/); he provides a [template website](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website), that I downloaded through a zip file[^zip] and unzipped on my computer. The template already has the correct hugo folders, includes a `config.yml` and includes the theme files,  so it is very easy to get started. From here on, it was mostly editing the existing files and adding my own materials. 

### Building Pages

- You need to get familiar with Markdown since that is the easiest way to write new content. You can also have `html` files. 

- When you want to create a page, you have to put a file in the `contents` folder. E.g. if you make a file `first_page.md` in `contents`, then when you run `hugo build` you will get a file `/first_page/index.html` generated in the build folder (typically `public` or `docs`), which can be accessed as `<baseURL>/first_page` once you post the site. 

- The `.md` files need to have the right heading to get processed by `hugo`:
```
---
title: "First Page"
date: 2025-01-25
description: "First Page"
--- 
```

- There are hugo commands to create new contents like `hugo new` 

- Static material goes into the `static` folder under the correct subfolder; so, e.g., images for the `first_page.md` can be put in `static/first_page/img/first_image.png` and can then be added to `first_page.md` with `![](img/first_image.png)`

- I had an [older website](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~kinget/home.html) and at this point have in many cases brought over the `html` files and converted them in `md` files with the right header, but still the html inside; see e.g. [Publications](../../publications/)

### Some Tips

- `hugo server` is very handy to view your webpages in a browser as you are writing them; some times the changes do you take, so you have to exit it and restart it. 

- The links to other pages or static material are sometimes a bit hard to figure out, so `hugo server` can be quite helpful with that. 


## GitHub Pages

### Some Tips

- When you update your repository on GitHub, it will start processing the files right away. To see the progress and any possible issues look at `Actions` for your repository. 

- If you decide to start a hugo site from scratch (and not from a template site like above), then you will likely install the 'theme' using git. Make sure to add it as a submodule, since you will sync your overall folder to your own repository. You will need to use something like `git submodule add <URL_for_theme_repository> <theme_folder>` and not `git clone`, otherwise GitHub will later have trouble publishing your site (see `Actions` mentioned above). 

## TO-DO

- Add commenting to posts using `utterances`. 

[^zip]: By using zip instead of `git clone` it's easier to then later connect the folder to your own GitHub repository.
