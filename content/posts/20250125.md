Proud to present my new website developed with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages and discuss here how I built the site. 

# How did I build this website?

**NOTE:** *I am not trying to write a full tutorial, there are (too) many already out there. I am outlining how I went about building this website and I am documenting some things I had to learn the hard way, i.e. lost too much time for something that was relatively simple in hindsight but I just did not find it easily in the existing tutorials.*

## HUGO

I am using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) since it's actively being developed, has various themes, and builds a static website from source files on your computer. You do not get locked into a hosting service's proprietary publishing software or templates. 

I further prefer the command-line nature of building the site with the `hugo` command and the publication of the site also happens from the commandline with `git`. I edit the 'source' files (.md, .yml, .html, ...) with `vscode` but you can use anything else. 

### Template

First, I googled [site:edu "powered by Hugo"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:.edu+%22powered+by+hugo%22) to see what templates academics are using. The ones that I liked were 'PaperMod', 'Hugo Cards', and 'Hugo Coder' for a personal profile site; 'Docks' and 'Academic Theme` are probably more suited for a research group site. 

I settled for [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) and more specifically used the [modified version by Pascal Michaillet](https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/); he provides a [template website](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website), that I downloaded through a zip file[^zip] and unzipped on my computer. The template already has the correct hugo folders, includes a `config.yml` and includes the theme files,  so it is very easy to get started. From here on, it was mostly editing the existing files and adding my own materials. 

### Configuring the Site
`config.yml` is the key file you need to customize from the template to make the site your own. 
- `baseURL` is important; it is the base URL for where you will be publishing the site; it needs to end with a `/`. 
- `menu` is for the menu in the upper right corner of the pages
- `params:` --> `profileMode:` --> `enabled: true` is what makes the root page a picture with some text and buttons. 
- `params:` --> `socialIcons:` show up on the profile page.

### Building Pages

- You need to get familiar with Markdown since that is the easiest way to write new content for Hugo. You can also have `html` files and even `org` files I believe. 

- When you want to create a page, you have to put a file in the `contents` folder. E.g. if you make a file `first_page.md` in `contents`, then when you run `hugo build` you will get a file `/first_page/index.html` generated in the build folder (typically `public` or `docs`), which can be accessed as `<baseURL>/first_page` once you post the site. 

- The `.md` files need to have the right heading to get processed by `hugo`:

```markdown
---
title: "First Page"
date: 2025-01-25
description: "First Page"
--- 
```

- There are hugo commands to create new contents like `hugo new` 

- Static material goes into the `static` folder under the correct subfolder; so, e.g., images for the `first_page.md` can be put in `static/first_page/img/first_image.png` and can then be added to `first_page.md` with `![](img/first_image.png)`

- I had an [older website](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~kinget/home.html) and at this point have in many cases brought over the `html` files and converted them in `md` files with the right header, but still the html inside; see e.g. [Publications](../../publications/)

### Some Tips

- `hugo server` is very handy to view your webpages in a browser as you are writing them; some times the changes 'do not take', so you have to exit it and restart it. 

- The links to other pages or static material are sometimes a bit hard to figure out, but `hugo server` can be quite helpful with that. 

-  Two ways of putting a figure in an .md file:
    -  `![](../images/photo_1996.gif)` is standard markdown,
    - `\{\{< figure src=\"../images/photo_jan_2011.png\" height=\"200px\">\}\}` is a hugo directive that allows you to control the size of the figure; the `\` do not need to be included, I needed them here to avoid errors for this page. 

- You can have links to headers in md pages; the link on top will point to the header below:

```markdown
| [Books](#books) | 

## Books 
- A first book to read
```

## GitHub Pages

I am using GitHub pages to host this site at `https://peterkinget.github.io` (so this my `baseURL` with an extra `/` at the end). 

You need to be familiar with GitHub repositories to understand the notes below. 

### Repositories

- I have a public repository `peterkinget.github.io` as GitHub recommends. I am only publishing the final site there though, not the original, full hugo site. 

- I have a separate 'source' repository `hugo-site` that I use to sync the full hugo folder on my computer. That folder gets published also as `https://peterkinget.github.io/hugo-site/` (again, make sure the baseURL is correct in `config.yml`). I find it useful to keep things separate and can verify updates before posting them on my actual site. 

### Publishing a repository
- In Github go to your repository --> Settings --> Pages --> 'Deploy from a branch' --> `main` & `/docs`. If all goes right, GitHub puts the URL on the top of this settings page, but you might have to wait a bit.
- Check the 'Actions' tab for the repository to see if the publishing was successful. 
- You need to instruct hugo to build in the `/docs` folder by having `publishDir: docs` near the top of your `config.yml` since GitHub can only serve your site from a `/docs` folder. 

- Since my base URL is set to `https://peterkinget.github.io/hugo-site/` in my 'source' `hugo-site` repo, I have to tell hugo to build the site with a different baseURL when I am ready to upload it to the `peterkinget.github.io` repo using `hugo build --baseURL "https://<the correct baseURL>/"`; then clear ( with `rm`) the `peterkinget.github.io` folder on my computer and `mv` the files from `hugo-site/docs` into the `peterkinget.github.io/` folder, followed by the `git` commands to add, commit, and push that folder to the repository. 

### Some Tips

- When you update your repository on GitHub, it will start processing the files right away. To see the progress and any possible issues look at `Actions` for your repository. 

- If you decide to start a hugo site from scratch (and not from a template site like above), then you will likely install the 'theme' using git. Make sure to add it as a submodule, since you will sync your overall folder to your own repository. You will need to use something like `git submodule add <URL_for_theme_repository> <theme_folder>` and not `git clone`, otherwise GitHub will later have trouble publishing your site (see `Actions` mentioned above). 

- You can use GitHub workflows to make the hugo site from the repository, but I have not tried that yet. Here is a [link](https://keanteng.github.io/home/docs/2023_04_09-creating-a-website-with-hugo--papermode/) I am saving for possible future use. 

## TO-DO

- Understand the 'posts' and 'posting' better, including `tags` and `categories`. 
- Add commenting to posts using `utterances`. 

[^zip]: By using zip instead of `git clone` it's easier to then later connect the folder to your own GitHub repository.
