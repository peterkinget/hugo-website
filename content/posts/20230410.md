**Posted on LinkedIn:** Happy to share a video Columbia Engineering made about the demo session for the VLSI Design Lab where students design a chip, get it fabricated, and demonstrate it. Proud of the hard work and dedication of the students and the TAs!! Many thanks to our 2022 sponsor Apple. 

Take a look at the [course website](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~kinget/EE6350_S22) for more details.
